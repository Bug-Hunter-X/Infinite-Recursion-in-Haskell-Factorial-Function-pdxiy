The corrected version of the factorial function explicitly handles the case of negative inputs, returning an error message or an appropriate value. Here's an example using `Maybe` to handle this case:
```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Maybe Integer
factorial 0 = Just 1
factorial n | n > 0 = Just (n * factorial (n-1)) >>= return . (*) . fromJust 
             | otherwise = Nothing

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (factorial 5) -- Output: Just 120
  print (factorial (-5)) -- Output: Nothing
```
This version uses Maybe to return Nothing if the input is negative, indicating the invalid input.  Alternatively, you could return an error message, throw an exception, or choose another appropriate method for handling invalid input.
