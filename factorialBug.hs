This Haskell code attempts to compute the factorial of a number using a recursive function. However, it contains a subtle bug related to pattern matching and the handling of the base case (factorial of 0). The function doesn't explicitly handle the case where the input is a negative number, leading to infinite recursion and eventually a stack overflow error.
